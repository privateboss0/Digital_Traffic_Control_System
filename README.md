# Traffic_Control_Algorithm
In respect with the modernization and digitalization of the traffic control infrastructure in 2023, I noticed the traffic control system is still using electronic circuits, so I designed and built multiple traffic control systems utilizing python code to allow free, organized and safe movement of humans, drivers and motor vehicles in an intelligent manner. They are as follows:

-Parking Garage Traffic Control System: A single light box, alternating between Red(STOP) and Green(GO) lights to allow safe and organized movement of cars and drivers in an automated parking garage.

-Pedestrian Traffic Control System: A dual light box, alternating between Red(STOP) and White(GO) light with sound aid/notification for the blind to allow for a safe and organized movement of disabled/wheelchair humans, pedestrians, bikers, skaters etc. on the road.

-Synchronous Traffic Control System: A centralized and synchronized triple light box for alternating between Red(STOP), Yellow/Amber(SLOW), and Green(GO) to allow safe and organized movement for vehicles on a three lane road. All the three individual traffic control lights are working synchronously to ensure the safety of motorists on a three lane road.

-Asynchronous Traffic Control System: A centralized and asynchronous triple light box for alternating between Red(STOP), Yellow/Amber(SLOW), and Green(GO) to allow safe and organized movement for vehicles on a three lane road. All three individual traffic lights are working asynchronously to ensure the safety of motorists on a three lane road.

-Decentralized Sync/Asyc single Traffic_control: A triple light box for alternating between Red(STOP), Yellow/Amber(SLOW), and Green(GO) to allow safe and organized movement for vehicles. The General traffic control system is also capable of (Single, Synchronous or Asynchronous) decentralized control for a one, two, three or multiple lane road, by simply running various instances of the code and adjusting the timers.

This can be further expanded using a Traffic Management Algorithm (Data Science) that integrates with this Traffic Control Algorithm using API's to adjust the timing setting of the control lights depending on the road usage congestion.
